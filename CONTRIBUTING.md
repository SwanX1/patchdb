# Information for Hacktoberfest participants

#### So, you've decided to pick this repository.

Thank you! It may not seem like much, but it does to me.<br>
First of all, please familiarize yourself with the Hacktoberfest [rules](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/participation) and [quality standards](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/qualitystandards)!<br>
Now onto the good stuff - **I'm accepting new features to this library!**
Yes, that's right! You can be the author of your very own feature in this library, given it's meaningful and qualitative enough, of course.

Pull Requests will be judged on a case-by-case basis, so feel free to spread your wings with the format and style of yours!
